# Connect Four

This project was built for an artificial intelligence course I took at Carleton University. The idea for the project was to build a simple game of "connect four" to play against an artificially intelligent opponent. It was built as a standalone OS X game built in Objective-C. 

The AI in this game uses the "Minimax" algorithm to determine the best move. It also uses alpha-beta pruning to minimize the number of potential future moves that need to be evaluated.
